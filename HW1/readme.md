# Executive Summary:
•	We achieve an F1 score of 0.68 on the provided test set using a bidirectional RNN model together with fully connected layers. 
•	Out of the ~40 features, we limit ourselves to 14 features based on our online research on Sepsis and perform various transformations that capture trends such as mean, variance, MAR and time-series. This approach seems to be validated in our Post Analysis.
•	Our model performs best on men and on patients whose unit is not marked.
